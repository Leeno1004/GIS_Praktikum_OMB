                hub in Spain. As <b>a leading world city</b>, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs
                qualifies it

            <p>Barcelona was the <em>20th-most-visited city in the world</em> by international visitors and the fifth
                most
                visited
                city
                in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011. By
                2015,
                both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its Rambles, Barcelona is ranked the most
                popular
                city to visit in Spain.
                Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of
                the
                best
                beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage
                Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016 including 35 five star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.

                Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal
                with
                pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides
                recommend
                that visitors take precautions to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro
                premises.
                Despite
                its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health
                security
                and
                personal
                #afety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over
                three
                years and
                has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider.</p>

            <p>The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the
                buildings date
                from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista
                architecture
                (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and
                left an
                important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially
                remarkable is
                the work
                of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but
                still unfinished
                church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by
                private
                donations.
                As of 2015, completion is planned for 2026.</p>
